# odin-recipes

The current project involves building a website with a main index page that
features links to a selection of recipes. The aim of this project is to hone 
my basic HTML skills, such as working with text, lists, links, and images.
By creating this website, I will gain practical experience in implementing
these fundamental elements of web design.
